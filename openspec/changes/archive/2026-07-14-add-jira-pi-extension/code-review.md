## Findings

| # | Finding | Severity | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `client.ts` `resolveSdkRoot` hardcodes mise node version paths (fragile on upgrade; failure graceful via D8) | P2 | open |
| 2 | `getArgumentCompletions` returns `[]` vs documented `null` idiom | P3 | open |
| 3 | `domain.md` blank line splits Out-of-scope list (cosmetic) | P3 | open |
| 4 | `agentEndCount` increments while disabled (harmless; nudges still gated) | P3 | open |
| 5 | Jira MCP URL committed in config.json (public endpoint, not a secret) | P3 | open |
| 6 | `looksLikeIssueKey` requires ≥2-char project key (Jira practice) | P3 | open |

Gate-manifest note: diff adds required `jira-extension-tests` row to
`openspec/opsx-gates.yaml` — additive only; no existing gate removed or
`required:true→false` flip.

## Applied fixes

- (none — quiet round; no P0/P1)

## Residual risks

- Hardcoded SDK path may need a follow-up after mise node bumps (P2 #1) —
  route to follow-ups at archive if desired; does not block intent outcomes.

## Verdict rationale

Round 1: both blind reviewers attested worktree HEAD `9b17da2` and returned
**pass** with zero open P0/P1. Round 2 (freshness after follow-ups-only
`6e790a4`): both reviewers again **pass**, P0+P1=0 — quiet round; no new
blocking findings. Diff delivers the frozen intent (standalone jira
extension, own mcp-remote client, session bind, full v1 commands,
latch-gated context, UI nudges, work-profile deploy, offline tests + gate).
Advisory P2/P3 from round 1 remain open in follow-ups; do not force another
round.
